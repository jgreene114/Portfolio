                    <p>Users select an area type, such as Congressional District, and an area, such as District 1.
                        They can then select media zones within that area to compare, and customize the color of each
                        selection. In addition to the data selections, users can modify the report in numerous ways.
                        Including showing/hiding various sections, displaying charts vs. tables, and elements of the map
                        style.</p>

                        and area masking, including changing the regions fill opacity and border width. All
                        visualizations in the application include a filter set (the area with the grey background below
                        "Summary Map"). This helps users minimize their chance of error by keeping track of their data
                        queries. Below the filter set is a legend, which corresponds to the selections made above.</p>
